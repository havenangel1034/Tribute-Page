				<h1>The World's Bestest Friend</h1>
				<body>
					<div>
					<p>Everyone needs a best friend like my own. Violet is the person thats been in my life for 8 years at this point. I met her when I was in 6th grade and we've been close ever since. If I could describe her in three words it'd be kind, determined, and bold.</p>

					<ul>Her hobbies</ul>
					<li>Gaming</li>
					<li>Writing</li>
					<li>Reading</li>
					<li>Ignoring my messages because she's "busy"</li>

					<p>In all honesty, people need friends like Violet. She gives me solid advice and talks me out of stupid decisions. I honestly don't know where I would be if she wasn't there telling me not to do half of the things I thought of or what I wanted to do. I'm her biggest supporter, and she's mine. I wish we lived a lot closer so we could actually binge watch the shows we both love like 911 and 911 Lonestar. And as her bestest friend, I always forget her birthday until its the day before or day of. I really need to put it in my calendar.</p>

					<h2>Facts about her life</h2>

					<p>9. She really does love ignoring my messages and the videos I send her</p>

					<p>Bonus: She's the short one. (Vi if you're reading this then yes, this is offensive <3)</p>

					<p>Although we sometimes annoy the hell at each other, she's still the bestest friend I could ever ask for. I thank God for putting Vi in my life.</p>
